# Grid

I've used [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_and_Progressive_Enhancement) example from MDN because I thought it was really interesting, especially with the new Grid Layout support. However, if you would like to use multiple blocks there still can be some issues like they've explained in their post.

## What is Grid?

"CSS Grid layout has been designed to provide a two-dimensional layout method for CSS, with the ability to lay out items in rows and columns. A CSS grid can be used to achieve many different layouts. It excels at dividing a page into major regions, or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives."

### Can I Use?

## Fallback

### floats

If the browser supports grid it will show a grid layout, but if it's an older browser then it will float the media and the item on the left side so you get the same result.
