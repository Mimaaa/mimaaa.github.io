## What is FLAC?

"FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is an audio coding format for lossless compression of digital audio, and is also the name of the reference codec implementation. Digital audio compressed by FLAC's algorithm can typically be reduced to 50â€“60% of its original size[citation needed] and decompress to an identical copy of the original audio data."

## Fallback

### <MP3>

If for instance you run a website that targets people who appreciate high quality audio, then using FLAC for all the audio files is something important to consider. However, if some of the people use very old browsers, then that would be an issue. Luckily you can give the audio element a second srcset - just like we did in the picture element. In this case I've used a .mp3 backup.
